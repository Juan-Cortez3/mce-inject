mce-inject allows to inject machine check errors on the 
software level into a running Linux kernel. This is intended for
validation of the kernel machine check handler.

Syntax:

mce-inject file ..

See SPEC for the input language

Some simple tests are in test/*.
Warning: some of them will panic the machine (this is intended)

Requires a new Linux kernel with error injection patches.
The error injection patches are currently available from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ak/linux-mce-2.6.git test

A more comprehensive test suite testing more machine check features
is available in mce-test
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mce-inject.git
